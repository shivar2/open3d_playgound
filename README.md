# open3d_playgound
This project is a personal exploration of the Open3D library â€” a powerful open-source toolkit for 3D data processing.
It includes experiments with point clouds, mesh reconstruction, noise removal, 3D Transformation and surface visualization techniques.

## ðŸ§± Discussion & Results
Preprocessing has a significant impact on the final reconstruction quality.
The choice of filters, radii, normal estimation parameters, and algorithm type (Poisson vs. BPA) can drastically change the mesh structure and level of detail.
There is no one-size-fits-all configuration â€” each dataset may require specific tuning based on point density, noise, and scale.  

In below, you can see a comparison of different reconstruction results to visualize how preprocessing choices affect the final surface.
